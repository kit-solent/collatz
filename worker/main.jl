#### Collatz Conjecture testing program
# takes about 5 minutes and 5.71 seconds to compute 10^10 numbers.
#
# the data file is in the following format:
# worker_id,starting_value,goal,current_value (optional)

# worker_id is the id that has been asigned to this worker.
# it is used when the assigned range has been fully computed
# to report success.

# starting_value is the value from which computations start.
# it is used as a fallback if current_value is not there.

# goal is the number up to which computation will occour.
# when this number is reached we can report success.

# current_value is our current progress in our computations.
# when chunks are computed current_value is incremented to
# reflect the numbers we have scanned. If not present
# starting_value can be used as a fallback.



# below is the mathematical reasoning behind my only testing numbers of the form 4n + 3

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

# README
# If you can't be bothered reading the wikipedia page here are the basics.
# the conjecture deffines a process when if a number n is even it is halved
# and if it is odd then 3n+1 is applied. It conjectures that EVERY positive
# integer will, with enough iterations of this process eventually reach 1
# where it will fall into the cycle: 1, 4, 2, 1
# (1 is odd so gets 3n + 1 to become 4 which is even and so gets halved to 2 and again to 1 again)
# There are two ways that a number could break this conjecture.
# a) if the number enters a loop that excludes 1
# b) if the number grows without bounds and tends to infinity.
# In either of these cases then the test(number::ZZRingElem) function will block forever
# this is not a problem though as most professional mathematicians consider this conjecture
# true and so we are really just proving what is probably true.
# The conjecture is still unproven however and so if you do perchance find a number that
# breaks it then you are instantly the worlds most famous mathematician of the 21st centuary.

# If a number ever falls below it's starting value it can be discarded. There are two ways of justifying this.
# a) since we are testing numbers starting low and going up, if a number ever drops below it's starting value
# then it must now be at a number we have already tested and found to be "normal" (does not break the conjecture)

# b) lets say that we are only searching for the lowest counterexample to the conjecture, then if a counterexample falls
# below it's starting value then we have found another lower counterexample so the first could not have been the lowest.
# this is because if n is a counterexample then EVERY number in it's sequence also must be a counterexample coz common sense.

# search space = all positive integers
# even numbers are imediatly halved (fall below starting value) so:
# search space = 2n + 1 (odd numbers)

# every second odd number (4n + 1) becomes:
# 3(4n + 1) + 1 = 12n + 4  is even so...
# 6n + 2                   still even so...
# 3n + 1
# 3n + 1 < 4n + 1 for n in positive integers so every 2nd odd number will certainly drop below it's starting value.

# search space = 4n + 3
#          *          *           *              * = can be excluded from the search.
# 4n + 3:  3  7 11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 ...      these are all odd so 1.5(4n + 3) + 0.5 = 6n + 5
# 6n + 5:  5 11 17 23 29 35 41 47 53 59 ...          still all odd so 1.5(6n + 5) + 0.5 = 9n + 8
# 9n + 8:  8 17 26 35 44 53 62 71 80 89 ...      every 2nd of which is even
#       :  4    13    22    31    40    ...      every 2nd of which is even again
#       :  2          11          20             which are all smaller. These are every 4th 4n + 3 number or 16n + 3

# So every 4th number of the form 4n + 3 can be discarded. # TODO: test 16n + 7, 16n + 11, 16n + 15

# every 4th term is 16n + 3 = 2(8n + 2) + 1 is odd so
# 1.5(16n + 3) + 0.5 = 24n + 5 = 2(12n + 2) + 1 is odd so
# 1.5(24n + 5) + 0.5 = 36n + 8 = 2(18n + 4) is even so
# 18n + 4                      = 2( 9n + 2) is even so
#  9n + 2 and 9n + 2 < 16n + 3 so can be discarded.

# Given that all numbers passed into test(number) are odd twice i.e. they are odd and so get 1.5n + 0.5 applied
# remain odd and so get it applied again, some steps could be precomputed to some degree.
